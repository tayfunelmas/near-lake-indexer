## 1.1.1

* Upgrade Indexer Framework to be based on version 1.39.1 and commit [60c8ad8](https://github.com/near/nearcore/commit/60c8ad88e5615e173963ac73e318db9337a17134)

This commit is based on 1.39.1 release of `nearcore` and includes the improvement of local cache from the `rc.2` release since that commit hasn't get into the 1.39.x release.

The fix is expected to be included in 1.40.0 `nearcore` release.

## 1.1.0

* Upgrade Indexer Framework to be based on version 1.39.0 and commit [2b2c06e](https://github.com/near/nearcore/commit/2b2c06edb90400fb934ae08a7083250266bff780)

This commit is based on 1.39.0 release of `nearcore` and includes the improvement of local cache from the `rc.2` release since that commit hasn't get into the 1.39.x release.

## 1.0.0

* Upgrade Indexer Framework to be based on version 1.38.2 and commit [8c2085b](https://github.com/near/nearcore/commit/8c2085b84ce7643fada081bfc5986b09b7e575eb)

This commit is based on 1.38.2 release of `nearcore` and includes the improvement of local cache from the `rc.2` release since that commit hasn't get into the 1.38.x release.

## 1.0.0-rc.2

* Upgrade Indexer Framework to be based on commit [511414a](https://github.com/near/nearcore/commit/511414a5091c3bef5c447a5644ba903dc050b715)

This commit adds the local cache to improve the speed of indexing during the congestion of the network.

This release is expected to be compatible with `nearcore` 1.38.x but we don't expect that improvement to be cherry-picked to the 1.38.x release.

* Bump the minimal supported Rust version to `1.76.0` (following the `nearcore` master branch)

## 1.0.0-rc.1

After two years of successful work in production we realized that no major changes or improvements have been made to the codebase. The codebase is stable and mature enough to be considered as a stable release. Thus, we are happy to announce the first release candidate of the NEAR Lake ðŸŽ‰

* Upgrade Indexer Framework to be based on [nearcore 1.38.0-rc.2](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases/tag/1.38.0-rc.2)
* Observability improvements:
  * `near_lake_block_retry_count_total` Total number of retries for storing indexing blocks to S3
  * `near_lake_block_done_total` Total number of indexed blocks
  * `near_lake_build_info` similar to the existing near_build_info, but I cannot reuse that since it's private. It will expose the build info. Example:
  ```
  near_lake_build_info{build="1.37.1",release="0.1.29",rustc_version="1.75.0"}
  ```

### Heads-up

Some updates on the `nearcore` side affected the Indexer Framework:
- `near_client` calls require the usage of `near_o11y::WithSpanContextExt`. Thus we depend on `near-o11y` explicitly since this version
- `init_configs` function has been extended with a parameter `download_records_url: Option<&str>`. Thus `init` command of the Lake Indexer has been extended with the parameter `donwload_genesis_records_url`
- `IndexerConfig` requires new parameter `validate_genesis: bool` so the `run` command has been extended with the key `--validate-genesis`
